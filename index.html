<p>I am going to implement a parallel selective search algorithm for object recognition in images.</p>

<h3>
<a id="background" class="anchor" href="#background" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Background</h3>

<p>One major requirement of an object recognition system is a high quality set of object hypotheses that describe locations for potential objects to be recognized. <a href="https://ivi.fnwi.uva.nl/isis/publications/2013/UijlingsIJCV2013/UijlingsIJCV2013.pdf">This paper</a> suggests a bottom up, hierarchical approach to the problem by taking segments of an image and greedily combining neighboring segments using various diversification and similarity strategies. <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/220569/ZitnickDollarECCV14edgeBoxes.pdf">Another paper</a> proposes a method using "edge boxes", in which the number of contours wholly contained in an edge box indicates the likelihood that it contains an object.  </p>

<h3>
<a id="challenges" class="anchor" href="#challenges" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Challenges</h3>

<p>The first challenge is to determine which method to employ, a decision which will likely be based largely on the amount of parallelism I can exploit from it.
In hierarchical approach, there is potential for parallelism here since we can spatially decompose the problem by considering pairs of segments in parallel; however, this will likely not produce the exact same results as the sequential greedy algorithm. Thus, one challenge will be to determine whether this relaxation of the algorithm actually matters. </p>

<h3>
<a id="resources" class="anchor" href="#resources" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Resources</h3>

<p>Since image regions provide richer features than individual pixels, Uijlings et al. perform image segmentation using a fast method proposed in <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/%7Epff/papers/seg-ijcv.pdf">this paper</a>. Luckily, this paper provides a C++ implementation of their algorithm, which I hope to use as a starting point for my implementation of selective search.</p>

<h3>
<a id="goals-and-deliverables" class="anchor" href="#goals-and-deliverables" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Goals and Deliverables</h3>

<p>I hope to complete a working implementation of selective search, which will, given an image, output an image with object proposals bound in boxes. I will first implement the sequential version as proposed in the paper and then implement a parallel version. I'll need some way to evaluate the parallel implementation, since its result will likely differ from the sequential version. Also, if time permits, I will attempt to speed up the image segmentation preprocessing step.</p>

<h3>
<a id="platform-choice" class="anchor" href="#platform-choice" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Platform Choice</h3>

<p>I have not yet decided on what platform I will run on, maybe CUDA. I will have to think more carefully about the parallelism involved before committing to a platform.</p>

<h3>
<a id="proposed-schedule" class="anchor" href="#proposed-schedule" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Proposed Schedule</h3>

<ul>
<li>4/2 - 4/9: Study papers and implement sequential algorithm </li>
<li>4/9 - 4/16 (Checkpoint): Decide on platform and begin parallel implementation </li>
<li>4/16 - 4/23: Continue parallel implementation</li>
<li>4/23 - 4/30: Finish parallel implementation and establish evaluation metrics</li>
<li>4/30 - 5/7: Perform evaluations and complete final write up</li>
<li>5/7 - 5/10: Buffer</li>
</ul>
