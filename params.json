{"name":"Parallel CKY Algorithm for Natural Language Parsing","tagline":"by Omar Rahman","body":"### Summary\r\n\r\nI will implement a parallel version of the CKY algorithm used for parsing natural language.\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n\r\nParsing is a fundamental component of many applications in natural language processing, including machine translation, semantic analysis, and information extraction. Since natural language is so vast and ambiguous, attempts at constructing a formal grammar result in hundreds of thousands of nonterminal rules and tens of thousands of terminal rules. The CKY algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm that parses in a worst case complexity of $O(|G|n^3)$, where $|G|$ denotes the size of the grammar and $n$ denotes the length of the sentence.\r\n\r\n### Challenges\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Resources\r\n\r\n\r\n### Goals and Deliverables\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Platform Choice\r\n\r\n\r\n### Proposed Schedule\r\n\r\n* 4/9 - 4/16 (Checkpoint): Implement baseline\r\n* 4/16 - 4/23: Continue parallel implementation\r\n* 4/23 - 4/30: Finish parallel implementation and establish evaluation metrics\r\n* 4/30 - 5/7: Perform evaluations and complete final write up\r\n* 5/7 - 5/10: Buffer\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
